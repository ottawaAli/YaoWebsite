                <h2>Hi, I'm Yao Huang.</h2>
                <p>I am currently a computer programming student studying at <a href="https://www.algonquincollege.com/" class="body-a italic-text" target="_blank">Algonquin college</a>. Algonquin College is widely recognized for its commitment to providing students with practical, industry-relevant education through hands-on, experiential learning opportunities.</p>  
				<p>In addition, I am a proud recipient of a bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from <a href="https://www.bupt.edu.cn/" class="body-a italic-text" target="_blank">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT)</a>, an esteemed institution that has built a formidable reputation for excellence in the field of telecommunications and engineering. </p>
				<p>In addition to my passion for ðŸ’»computer programming, I indulge in various other hobbiesðŸ˜ƒ. I enjoy playing card games and video games, playing the pianoðŸŽ¹ and violinðŸŽ», cooking Chinese&#127836; and Western&#127789; cuisine, baking desserts&#127849;, singing karaoke, reading and traveling. Apart from China<span class="flag-icon flag-icon-cn"></span> and Canada<span class="flag-icon flag-icon-ca"></span>, I have had the pleasure of experiencing the beauty and diversity of countries such as Japan<span class="flag-icon flag-icon-jp"></span>, Nepal <span class="flag-icon flag-icon-np"></span>, Thailand<span class="flag-icon flag-icon-th"></span>, Egypt <span class="flag-icon flag-icon-eg"></span>, the United States <span class="flag-icon flag-icon-us"></span>, France<span class="flag-icon flag-icon-fr"></span>, Switzerland<span class="flag-icon flag-icon-ch"></span> and several European countries.

				<p>As a new immigrant, I bring with me several years of experience working in internet companies, Fin-tech companies, and startups.

Additionally, my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and adapt to changing environments has been recognized through the attainment of my tax certification.</p>
				<p> I look forward to embracing a better quality of life, enriched with diverse cultural experiences and a supportive community that fosters innovation and success&#127752;.</p>			         	  			</div>
